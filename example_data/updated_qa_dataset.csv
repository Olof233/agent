question,answer,score
What is machine learning?,Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.,9.5
How does neural network work?,Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neurons that process information through interconnected nodes.,9.2
What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?,"Supervised learning uses labeled data for training, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.",8.8
Explain backpropagation algorithm,Backpropagation is an algorithm that calculates gradients of the loss function with respect to network weights.,9.0
What are activation functions in neural networks?,"Activation functions introduce non-linearity into neural networks, enabling them to learn complex patterns.",8.5
How to prevent overfitting in machine learning?,"Overfitting can be prevented through regularization, cross-validation, and using more training data.",8.7
What is deep learning?,Deep learning uses multiple layers of neural networks to learn hierarchical representations of data.,9.3
Explain gradient descent optimization,Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that minimizes loss by updating parameters in the direction of steepest descent.,8.9
What is the role of bias in neural networks?,"Bias terms allow neural networks to shift the activation function, improving model flexibility.",8.3
How does convolutional neural network work?,CNNs use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input data.,9.1
What is transfer learning?,"Transfer learning is a technique where a model trained on one task is adapted for a related task, improving performance and reducing training time.",8.6
